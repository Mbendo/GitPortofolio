# AI Portofolio
welcome to my portofolio, here i will showcase my projects of learning how to be an AI Engineer

## About Me
Hello, I’m Benando, you can call me Ben, an AI engineer with a Computer Science degree from Universitas Pertamina. I have a strong passion for artificial intelligence and its applications in various domains. I have experience in Computer Vision projects as stated here in my portofolio page. For my bachelor’s thesis, I developed Acne Classification using CNN, where i analyze the efectiveness of a cut down VGGNet architecture. I’m eager to learn new technologies and methodologies in AI engineering and collaborate with other professionals in this field.

## What is here? / Table of contents
1. Face Detection
2. Image Cartoonizer
3. Face Mask detection (WIP)
4. Acne Classification using CNN (My Thesis)

## Detail
### [Face Detection](https://github.com/Mbendo/Face-Detection)
this is a basic face shape detection using the Haar Cascade Classifier, can be used in Input Images or Live Video

### [Image Cartoonizer](https://github.com/Mbendo/Image-Cartoonizer)
this is a basic image cartoonizer, where it applies a filter on top of an image by identifying borders

### [Face Mask Detection(WIP)](https://github.com/Mbendo/Image-Cartoonizer)
(WIP)
This is a step up from my face detection, where it will recognize when a face is wearing a mask, or not wearing a mask

### My Thesis, [Acne Classification using CNN](https://github.com/Mbendo/DeteksiJerawat)
This is made for my thesis, where i train a model on 5 different acne, using a Cut Down variation of VGGNet, where i analyze the viability of it
